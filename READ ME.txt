Signal Analysis is the only function needed for
this project. 

All filters are found in the MATLAB folder.

All .wav files are automatically saved to the WAV folder

All figures are saved to the picture subfolder in the DOC folder

To run SignalAnalysis:

SignalAnalysis(x)

if x is a .wav file (with the .wav extension) it will run the
appropriate .wav file



else, if x is an integer, it will do the following:

0 = gaussian noise added to wave1

1 = poisson noise added to wave1

2 = salt & pepper noise added to wave1

3 = speckle noise added to wave1

4 = Low Frequency beep from wave1

5 = High Frequency beep from wave1

6 = nsp0 filter

7 = nsp1 filter

8 = nsp2 filter

9 = nsp3 filter

-------------------------------------------

For the beta of project 2, I have fully finished all
required filters, all required matlab code, and automated
all of the file generation and organization. All that is left
is writing out the documentation for it.
